Task 1: rename multiple files from "task 1" > "files-oldnames" using a PowerShell script. They should follow the naming convention: Task-Done_1, Task-Done_2, ..., Task-Done_9; and you should consider that "mydocument.txt" is the first file.

Task 2: find in the two text files the word "bad" and replace by "nice" using a PowerShell script.
